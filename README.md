## Our responses

**The appropriateness of the goals of the plan and of the strategies and implementation tactics proposed to achieve them**

A major strategic plan should begin with well-defined ultimate objectives, success criteria, and keen insight supported by research and analysis into the most pressing root causes of the inefficiencies in the current practices of data management across relevant disciplines. 

The proposed plan does not appear to treat data management as a serious subject worthy of a critical approach.  In the introduction, it even dismisses data management as something that scientists least like to do (and therefore should do less of), an inherently noncreative process that takes away from their more worthwhile pursuits.  Unfortunately, this attitude is pervasive among many scientists who think of data organization as an afterthought, something to take care of before submitting their paper.  The authors reveal their own lack of value placed on data collection and organization, and their proposal reflects this culture. 

In contrast, bioscience is inevitably marching in the direction of data-centric collaborative endeavors that are fluid and long-term.  This will require a cultural shift. Teams of scientists will craft their data pipelines to reflect the evolving structure of their experiments and analysis.  As the data complexity increases, proper data organization will need to planned and designed with the same attention and rigor as the design of experiment.

Implementing such collaborations requires prioritizing data organization, changing the social contract and the incentive structure between scientists who collect, organize, and process data to make it available for timely analysis by the broader community.  The NIH plan for data science could become the force multiplier by facilitating the required change to make data collection and management a valued skill and appreciated effort. 

Unfortunately, the proposed plan does not acknowledge the root causes of data inefficiencies in the bioscience and will do little to address them.  It conceives of data management as a separate activity performed after the main creative work is complete.  The authors believe that the two major obstacles to  efficient data management are 

1. lacking repository infrastructure and tools and 
2. lacking enforcement of data quality standards for publication.  

Implementing these solutions will do little to encourage scientists to organize and share data other than to meet the minimal requirements for the small fraction of the data that they publish to support their findings.
